## Task Answers

> 1. Create a custom post type called ‚ÄúPok√©mon‚Äù whose slug should be ‚Äúpokemon‚Äù.

**Answer:**  
The new post type "pokemon" is available at the URL:  
https://your-site-url/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=pokemon

---

> 2. This post type must contain the following properties:  
> a. Photo of the pokemon  
> b. pokemon name  
> c. pokemon description  
> d. primary and secondary type of pokemon  
> e. pokemon weight  
> f. Pokedex number in older version of the game (you can find this info in the api)  
> g. Pokedex number in the most recent version of the game (you can find this info in the api)  
> h. (Optional) The attacks of said pok√©mon with its short description (in English). Said attacks must be stored as desired, considering efficiency and possible reuse.

**Answer:**  
All these properties have been implemented as post meta fields associated with the "pokemon" post type.

---

> 3. Generate 3 pokemon manually with the data requested in point 2 using the Pok√©API.

**Answer:**  
I've added a button in the admin panel to generate Pok√©mon manually. You can access it here:  
https://your-site-url/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=pokemon

---

> 4. Create a template for the custom post type "pokemon" and display:  
> a. Photo of the pokemon  
> b. pokemon name  
> c. pokemon description  
> d. Pok√©mon types (primary and secondary)  
> e. Number of the pokedex in the most recent version and the name of the game  
> f. Button in which, when clicked, an AJAX call is made to WordPress to show the number of the pok√©dex of said pok√©mon in the oldest version of the game with the name of said version.  
> g. (optional) Table of movements of the pok√©mon with two columns:  
> i. movement name  
> ii. movement description

**Answer:**  
The Pok√©mon details page is available at:  
https://your-site-url/pokemon/{pokemon-name}/  
It includes all requested information and AJAX functionality.

---

> 5. (Optional) Create a pok√©mon filter (TypeScript): Initially, this page will show a grid with the photos of the pok√©mon stored in the database. The user must be able to filter by type (the first 5 types returned by Pok√©API). When a filter is selected it should hide the photos of the pokemon whose first or second type does not match the selected filter. Limit to 6 pokemon per page.

**Answer:**  
The filter page is available at:  
https://your-site-url/pokemon-list/  
It supports filtering by type and pagination with 6 Pok√©mon per page.

---

> 6. (Optional) Create a custom url (for example http:/localhost/random) that shows a random pok√©mon stored in the database. Said URL must redirect to the permanent link of the returned pok√©mon.

**Answer:**  
The random Pok√©mon is available at:   
https://your-site-url/random/

---

> 7. (Optional) Create a custom url (for example http://localhost:generate) that when summoned will spawn a random pokemon by calling the Pok√©API. It can only be invoked by users who have post creation permissions or higher. This generated pokemon must be stored in WordPress as if it were a manually created post with the same data specified in point 2.

**Answer:**  
This generate URL is available at:  
https://your-site-url/generate/  
It requires user permissions for post creation.

---

> 8. (Optional) Using the WordPress REST API, generate an endpoint to list stored pok√©mon showing as ID the pok√©dex number in the most recent version of the game. Generate another endpoint to consult the data of the pokemon requested in point 2 in JSON format.

**Answer:**  
Developed custom REST API endpoints:  
- `/wp-json/fever-code-challenge/v1/pokemon` ‚Äî lists Pok√©mon with IDs as recent Pokedex numbers  
- `/wp-json/fever-code-challenge/v1/pokemon1/{id}` ‚Äî returns detailed JSON data for a Pok√©mon

---

> 9. (Optional) Would it be possible to implement DAPI (or other similar APIs) in the developed solution? If so, what changes and abstractions would you propose in the different layers of the application to facilitate said integration? (the implementation is optional)

**Answer:**  
Yes, it is possible to implement DAPI or other similar APIs by introducing an abstraction layer and using dependency injection to swap API implementations easily.

For example, in the main plugin file `wp-content/plugins/fever-code-challenge/src/Plugin.php`, the constructor depends on an API interface `IAPI`:

```php
/**
 * Plugin constructor.
 *
 * @param IAPI   $api              Injected API instance.
 * @param string $plugin_file_path Path to main plugin file (__FILE__).
 */
public function __construct(IAPI $api, string $plugin_file_path) {
    $this->api        = $api;
    $this->plugin_url = untrailingslashit(plugin_dir_url($plugin_file_path));
    $this->plugin_dir = dirname($plugin_file_path);
}
````

To support another API in the future, you would:

1. Create a new class implementing the same `IAPI` interface, e.g., `DapiAPI`.

2. Initialize the plugin with the desired API implementation by changing the plugin initialization hook from:

```php
add_action('plugins_loaded', array(new Plugin(new API\PokeAPI(), __FILE__), 'init'));
```

to

```php
add_action('plugins_loaded', array(new Plugin(new API\DapiAPI(), __FILE__), 'init'));
```

This approach leverages **dependency injection**, allowing flexible swapping of API clients without modifying the core plugin logic.

---

> 10. (Optional) The instance becomes more and more popular and starts receiving a lot of traffic generating heavy DB usage. What would you do in this situation?

**Answer:**
To handle increased traffic and DB load:

* Implement caching (object cache, page cache, REST API cache)
* Use a CDN for assets and images
* Optimize database queries and add indexes
* Offload heavy tasks to background jobs or queues
* Scale infrastructure horizontally (load balancing, read replicas)
* Consider DB engine upgrades or optimization
